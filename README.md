EnergyApp
==========

EnergyApp is a simple webapp that retrieves and displays values from an [emoncms](http://emoncms.org/) instance.
It is currently a work-in-progress, so it may be broken at times. ^^;

## Usage

Clone to a public web directory on the server with your emoncms instance, and replace the values at the top of application.js with your read-only API Key and publicly-accessible hostname/IP Address.
